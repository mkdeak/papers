    The aim of this first part is to present the idea of a scheme relative to a symmetric monoidal category $\ccat$.
    We start with a general process of construction of Grothendieck topologies from prestacks in categories satisfying certain conditions.
    This allows us to then define the \emph{faithfully flat and quasi-compact topology}, as well as the \emph{Zariski topology} in the very general setting.
    We will afterwards define the idea of a relative scheme by gluing back together affine objects with the help of the Zariski topology.
